description: >-
  In this outstanding work, Ishmael, the narrator, recounts the epic story of
  the insane quest that he becomes a part of as he boards the whaleship Pequod.
  It is the story of Captain Ahab, the vengeful whaler and his pursuit of Moby
  Dick, the elusive white whale, who on a previous voyage destroyed his boat and
  left Ahab a crippled and obsessive monomaniac. The insanity and the blind need
  for vengeance evoke fear and doubt in his crew members as Ahab threatens to
  lead the ship and all its members to an adventurous, yet increasingly,
  precarious culmination. Will Ahab recognize his own madness before the high
  seas of vengeance? This classic edition is a must-read for all! - This
  hardbound edition comes with gilded edges, a ribbon bookmark, and beautiful
  endpapers - It proves to be infinitely open to interpretation and discovery -
  A chock-full of sea adventures - An insightful and fascinating read - The epic
  tale will keep you hooked to the pages
