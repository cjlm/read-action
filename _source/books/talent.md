  Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross's Talent offers strategies on how to spot,
  assess, woo, and retain highly talented people. How do you find talent with a
  creative spark? To what extent can you predict human creativity, or is human
  creativity something irreducible before our eyes, perhaps to be spotted or
  glimpsed by intuition, but unique each time it appears? The art and science of
  talent search get at exactly those questions. Renowned economist Tyler Cowen
  and venture capitalist and entrepreneur Daniel Gross guide the reader through
  the major scientific research areas relevant for talent search, including how
  to conduct an interview, how much to weigh intelligence, how to judge
  personality and match personality traits to jobs, how to evaluate talent in
  on-line interactions such as Zoom calls, why talented women are still
  undervalued and how to spot them, how to understand the special talents in
  people who have disabilities or supposed disabilities, and how to use
  delegated scouts to find talent. Identifying underrated, brilliant individuals
  is one of the simplest ways to give yourself an organizational edge, and this
  is the book that will show you how to do that. It is both for people searching
  for talent, and for those being searched and wish to understand how to better
  stand out.
